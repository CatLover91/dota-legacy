# My old DotA Maps

This repo contains all of the old DotA maps I used to play on. Feel free to download them and relive the olden days of DotA. Introduction of heroes like Techies (dota 2's techies week was not the first time that I had felt such pain) and bristleback (he sucked back in the day) are represented in these maps. Also included are several community-made AI maps of various versions, with the AI's matching the playstyle of the pub-era back in the day. Reckless solo dives for kills and timely turnarounds for defense were rampant in pub days. Some odd maps, such as a 6v6 map, are included as well. If anything, these are great to practise denying on, and they allow build idea generation that is scoffed at in the current meta. The old builds may still work, too (for example, rushing bfly for Juggernaught was core back in the day for his AS Ult build). My first map, 6.29b from 2006 is a map I love with all my heart. Look at the change in heroes and wonder at the changelogs of time.

## Installation

You need an install of Warcraft 3 and the expansion, The Frozen Throne. They do not need to be up to date for offline play, but they need updates to go online. The client will auto-update when trying to connect online. The modern map is not included (which is what is played online), but it is downloadable at www.getdota.com. The players will auto-kick you if you do not have a modern map.

Once TFT is installed, go into the expansion's directory (not the original), and open the maps folder. Inside, if there is not a Downloads folder, make one. Download these files and whatever other maps you want in there, and fire her up. 

Dota 1's mode picking is all text based. AI maps obviously have more commands. The map mode is decided by the first person who types it (you can imagine the trolls galore).

You can chain non-overlapping commands

Common commands:
-ar (All Random)
-ap (All Pick)
-cm (Captains Mode)
-cd (Captains Draft)
-sd (Single Draft)
-rd (random draft)
-em (easy mode)

-em is chainable with all of the above. -apem is most popular for scrubs, -ap for tryhards. -em gives extra EXP from creep kills and extra GPM much like Normal Mode does to Ranked in DotA 2. There are many more commands, read the prompts upon connecting to the map.
